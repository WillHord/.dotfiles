# .dotfiles
A way to backup and install my settings on new machines

## Description
A backup of my dotfiles and an install script to make it easier to set up new machines. The install script is based on a script by [Bartek Spitza](https://github.com/bartekspitza/dotfiles/tree/master). My version allows for the installation of both private and public files as well as the ability to backup config files. My private files are not included in this repository but I use it for API Keys I want to have on multiple machines. 

## Getting Started

### Installing
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:WillHord/.dotfiles.git
```
2. Run the install script
```
./install.sh
```
